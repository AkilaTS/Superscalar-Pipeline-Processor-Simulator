# Superscalar-Pipeline-Processor-Simulator
C++ program to simulate the working of a superscalar pipeline processor

The superscalar features implemented are fetching and decoding two instructions per cycle, a centralized reservation station, reorder buffer and store buffer. 
There are two ALU units, each is assumed to take one cycle latency.

The output will be printed in the "Output.txt" file. The changes in the register file and Data Cache after running the program are reflected in the input files itself ("RF.txt" and "DCache.txt").
